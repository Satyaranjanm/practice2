			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
			The LBNL DR Automation Server (DRAS) (previously called price server) is at the heart of 
			the controls and communications architecture for Automated Demand Response tests conducted 
			by the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in 2003, 04, 05 and 06.
			</p>
			<p>
			The DRAS enables utilities, grid system operators and other entities to remotely initiate 
			preplanned automated sheds of electric loads in commercial and industrial facilities.  The 
			automated sheds can be initiated based on economic or contingency based grid conditions.   The 
			DR signals are transmitted using the existing public Internet and private wide area 
			networks (WANs).  Facilities can be connected to the DRAS using either software or hardware 
			based gateways or other interface devices.
			</p>
			<p>
 			Once a shed event is initiated by the appropriate decision-makers, the DRAS automatically manages 
 			all communications, time buffering, and on-site connections to enable demand reductions for the 
 			pre-planned duration using pre-planned strategies.  Unless a facility manager &quot;opts-out&quot; using 
 			their personalized website, sheds will occur without human intervention.

			<hr/>
			<p>
			Version 1.0 was designed and used as a research tool in 2003 and 2004.&nbsp; 
			Version 2.0 was pilot production tool designed and used as the automation "engine" of 
			PG &amp; E&apos;s Auto-CPP program in 2005.&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<p>
			Version 2.0 was built from scratch to meet the high standards required for financial 
			transactions using Internet technology.  The version 2.0 server successfully met the 
			requirements for the 2005 tests including:
 			</p>
 			<ol>
 				<li>
 				Flexibility - The system was customized to interface with PG&amp;E&quot;s existing 
 				CPP processes and Itron&quot;s Interact system. 
	 			</li>
	 			<li>
	 			High availability/reliability - The system successfully processed every PG&amp;E initiated 
	 			Auto-CPP event.  Since coming online, DRAS has maintained it&quot;s availability target 
	 			of 99.99%. (four nines)
	 			</li>
	 			<li>   
	 			Scalability - Tests show that the 2.0 framework was more than adequate for the ~ 20 sites 
	 			in the 2005 pilot.  Scalability tests indicate that the current system could support 
	 			approximately 30,000 "sites" per server with an end-to-end latency averaging less than ½ 
	 			second.  Modular software is designed to enable support of millions of sites by simply 
	 			adding servers and other standard IT equipment.
	 			</li>
	 			<li>   
	 			Security - The DRAS architecture was designed so as to be secure enough to meet current 
	 			industry standards for financially binding transactions.   It is of utmost importance 
	 			that Auto-DR tests are secure.   A security breech could become a major public relationship 
	 			setback to the industry.  
	 			</li>  
			</ol>
			<p>
			&nbsp;<b>Figure 2</b> shows the control and communication architecture used by the 
			DRAS in 2006.&nbsp; Communications occur in the following sequence: 
			</p>
			<ol>
			    <li>
			    	Utility defines the start time and duration of the Auto-DR event&nbsp;
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	Auto-DR event info published on DR Automation Server&nbsp;
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	Polling clients check event status and signal EMCS when to enter shed mode(s)&nbsp;
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	EMCS carries out pre-determined shed strategies
			    </li>
			</ol>

				<h3>DR Automation Server 2006</h3>
				<p>
					LBNL is currently working to enhance 
					the DRAS based on feedback from utilities, installation contractors and other 
					stakeholders.&nbsp; The overall Auto-DR project for 2006 has several major themes.&nbsp; 
					These themes, along with technical lessons learned from previous years will 
					drive many of the features and other enhancements of the DR Automation Server 
					for 2006:
				 </p>
			<ol>
			    <li>
			  Process turnover.&nbsp; Researchers at LBNL plan to further define and 
			  document DR processes and turn over more tasks to others (utilities and other 
			  3rd parties).
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Provision of secure, reliable, customized interfaces to multiple 
			  utility partners.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Sharing of real-time, system-level, non-sensitive DR information 
			  with the CEC, CAISO and other parties.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Continued enhancements in performance and usability.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Cost optimization.
			    </li>
			  </ol>
			  The aforementioned overall project themes and 
			  lessons learned from previous years drive the need for the following 
			  categories of enhancements to the DR Automation Server for 2006:
			  <ol>
			    <li>
			  Support for event "trigger" signals from multiple sources (e.g., 
			  from different utility systems).
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Support for additional password protected user types.&nbsp; (e.g., users 
			  of the system with various roles have access to various parts of the system).
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Enhanced the design and manufacturing process for the hardware 
			  interface devices to each participating site.&nbsp; Client Logic w/ Integrated 
			  Relay (CLIR) Box.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Enhance reliability and reduce maintenance requirements.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Enable the DR Automation Server for 2006 to be hosted at the LBNL managed hosting co-lo or 
			  at a utilities network operations center or both.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Improved operator tools for status display and log visualization.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			  Continued attention to security and scalability.&nbsp;
			    </li>
			  </ol>
			  Input from utilities and CAISO will be 
			  encouraged during the development phase of the DR Automation Server 2006.&nbsp; In 
			  addition, their involvement with this project will hopefully help them in the 
			  future to create their own systems and/or help in the design of future 
			  revisions of the LBNL DR Automation Server.
