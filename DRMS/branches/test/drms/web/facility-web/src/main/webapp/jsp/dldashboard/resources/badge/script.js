 Abstract: This example webpage showcases a variety of CSS visual 
 effects.  Buttons and other page elements are styled with CSS gradients
 and shadows, menus are animated with CSS transitions, custom fonts are 
 displayed with CSS web fonts, and elements are positioned, scaled, and 
 rotated on the page using CSS transforms.  The entire interface is drawn
 and animated without using any images or plug-ins.
