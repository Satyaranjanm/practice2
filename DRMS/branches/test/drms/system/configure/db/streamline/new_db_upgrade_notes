** bid_level_mapping
   new FK to program_participants, drop implied FK to participants.
   used participants_uuid and programName as natual key to create an insert statement
   into program_participant_uuid in BLM.

** contacts
   Asumed that "state" was renamed to "contactState"
   ownerID becomes program_uuid
   message_filter_setting is assumed to have 1 row only.
   participant_uuid is a mistake, there should really be a many-many between participant and contact.
   TODO: fix mapping between contact and participant, move participant_contact data to new participantContact table.

** contacts_offline_error
    What is participantUuid (new column) for? duplicate of participant_uuid
    new columns participantUuid, program_uuid, contact_uuid
    TODO: map the above columnts
    cannot find a way to map program_uuid. Tried through the contact relationship, but all values are null.
    find out if the contact_uuid and contactsUuid columns are redundant
    Per veera, keep two columns for now.

** db_version

** event
  Several additional columns, don't know if they come from another table.
  20110311 Look at the new schema from veera to check

** event_bid_block
  No major issues

** event_participant_bid_entry
  No major issues

** event_participant_rule
  No major issies

** event_participant_signal_entry
  No major issues
  may fail if expired int(3) can't convert to bit

** event_signal_entry
  No major issues

** event_state
  eventModNumber and eventStateId may be wrong int(10) unsigned vs. int(11)
  didn't drop default = 0 on eventModNumber
  should programName be dropped since program_uuid exists?

** event_template
	Note that event_template is empty in sce production, is it used?
	Data migration scripts have not been tested against actual data since there is none.

** event_template_signal_entry
	No major issues

** event_timeblock
	endTime and startTime may be wrong int(10) unsigned vs. int(11)

**** message
	Should contactId be dropped since contact_uuid is there?
	contact_uuid is not null, all contactId's in SCE are null, this conversion is impossible.
	T nversion
	20110311 Keep contactId for now till java code is refactored.

** message_filter_setting
 	Various default='0' were not changed to default=null

** noaa_weather
	No major issues

** participant_manualsignal
	Creation time is null for all values, not - null constraint will fail.

** program
	Cannot add bid_config relationship as not null. Only 2 bid config entries exist for sce.
	creationTime will fail on sce due to a null value.
	autoAccept default null wasn't dropped.
	20110311 per veera should be nullable.

** program_participant
	optStatus is missing from the new ddl, it was added late in 6.4. Kept this column in migration.
	program_participant_uuid actually should be named program_participant_constraint_uuid.
	program_participant_uuid is not null, however there are no program_participant_constraints to reference so migration is impossible.

** program_participant_bid_level_map
	not null on creation time has 8 null values in sce.
	20110311 Create time for missing values in SCE.

** program_signal_entry
	conversion of expired from tinyint(3) to bit(1) could cause problems.

** report_event
	No major issues

** report_event_participation
	type (keyword) wasn't renamed
	what is the relationship between report_event? programName + eventName? what about participantName?
	dropping participantName will lose data.
	not null constraint on report_event_uuid will result in massive loss of data.

** report_event_signal
	cannot satisfy not null constraint on report_event_uuid
	will result in loss of data.
	dropping participantName will result in loss of data.
	20110311 per veera, should be good through report_event_uuid.

** rtp_remote_price
	programName is not dropped. Redundant to program_uuid
	eventName dropped, does this result in data loss (check mappings).
